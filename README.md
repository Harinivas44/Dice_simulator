# ðŸŽ² Dice Simulator 

Welcome to the Dice Simulator project! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ²

Have you ever wanted to roll a dice but didn't have one at hand? No worries! This simple Python-based Dice Simulator has got you covered. ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²

This project is all about simulating the experience of rolling a dice using Python.

This project is a fun and engaging way to experience the excitement of rolling a dice without needing the actual physical object. ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to customize the code or share it with friends who might find it entertaining. Happy rolling! ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²


## How It Works:

1. Run the code, and the dice simulator will start.

2. It will randomly generate a number between 1 and 6, just like a real dice.

3. Based on the number rolled, the simulator will display a graphical representation of the dice face using text characters. ðŸŽ°

4. You can keep rolling the dice as many times as you want by typing 'Yes' or 'yes'. If you're done rolling, simply type anything else to exit the simulator.
